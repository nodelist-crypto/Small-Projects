          <h2>Pakistan First Governor-General</h2>
          <p id="intro">
            <b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah </b>was a barrister, politician and the
            founder of Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India
            Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August
            1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general
            until his death. Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was
            trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon his
            return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an
            interest in national politics, which eventually replaced his legal
            practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress
            in the first two decades of the 20th century. In these early years
            of his political career, Jinnah advocated Muslimâ€“Hindu unity,
            helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the
            All-India Muslim League, in which Jinnah had also become prominent.
            Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and
            proposed a fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard
            the political rights of Muslims in the Indian subcontinent. In 1920,
            however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow
            a campaign of satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
